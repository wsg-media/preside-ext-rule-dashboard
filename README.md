# preside-ext-rule-dashboard

The extension allows you to display statistics of rules execution over time in a dashboard. 

So for example, you could create some simple rules that show how many people have registered that day, and create another one on how many people have activated their account, then display a graph of the results of these over time. 

Pretty much any rules can be used, and you can schedule how often you want to collect this information. You can then use the widgets in the dashboard to select any number of these rules as multiple datasets in a graph.

It uses Pixl8's admin dashboard extension, and chartjs to render the graphs.

Have a good read of https://github.com/wsg-media/preside-ext-rule-dashboard/wiki/Using-the-extension to see how to use it

Your feedback is most welcome.
